FARMLY NEIGHBOUR
This project aims to develop an e-commerce website for buying and selling agricultural products. The primary goal is to enable farmers to showcase and sell their products directly to consumers through an online platform. The developed system helps reduce the steps involved in traditional sales processes, increases marketing opportunities, and provides convenience for both buyers and sellers. The website is designed to include all the essential functions of a complete e-commerce system, such as user registration, product management, ordering, payment processing, product reviews, and store management. Technical Details the website was developed using the Next.js framework with TypeScript, and it connects to a PostgreSQL database via Prisma ORM. It supports user authentication through OAuth providers such as Google and Facebook. The system is deployed using Amazon Web Services (AWS) including services like EC2, RDS, and S3, allowing for 24/7 accessibility. This project demonstrates the feasibility of applying web application technologies to effectively and sustainably enhance the Thai agricultural sector's transition into online commerce.
